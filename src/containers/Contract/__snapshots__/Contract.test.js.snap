      Reengineered an obsolete code base for Colorado's public school's to have direct communication with emergency services in the event of an emergency. Our team rebuilt a MySQL database with Node.js and PostgreSQL, redesigned a Flash and PHP front end with React.js and Redux, and established communication between front end systems and IoT devices. Featured Bcrypt, JWT, and Secure Cookies for authentication and sessioning.

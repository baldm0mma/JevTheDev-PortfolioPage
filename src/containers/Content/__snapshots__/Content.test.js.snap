      This is the first NPM Package I've ever written! I love contributing to free, opensource code, and I'm really excited for this to be my first home-baked contribution! There are four components in total, a styled h1, a styled paragraph text, and two styled and controlled forms. The h1 and paragraph texts take a single prop, which is the text that they will display; and the two form components take two props each; one is the text title for the form, and the second is a callback function that returns the current controlled state of the form inputs. It was a blast to make, and I hope someone gets some use out of it!
